# Hello-World
My first repository

I am Hieu. I graduated last year from college. The day of graduation was miserable. I felt like I had failed. 
I lived at a Zen Center for awhile, as an act of running away. But in fact, the Zen experience has really opened me up to life. 
I am glad I did that and I am excited to move forward with my life, stronger, and more comfortable with not knowing. 
I am okay with the certainty now, better than I was during my last year of college. 
My goal right now is to become a great coder. One who can create and build amazing things that no one ever imagined. 

Thank you for your attention!
